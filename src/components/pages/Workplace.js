                                Unskilled employ can diminish the success of an
                                establishment because they don’t have the relevant skill
                                required to drive the workforce of the organization and
                                also if an employee of an organization is not trained to
                                level up their skill to match up to the role they are being
                                hired for then they will have no contribution to the
                                organization and there is no organization that will want
                                to hire an employee that will be dormant to their duty.
                                No organization will tolerate such rather they find a
                                replacement with an immediate effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most organization are not looking for who to hire and
                                make a huge expense on training them rather than to
                                find an expert to fill the vacant space. They mostly look
                                for people with years of experience which will be
                                criteria in hiring an employee into that organization and
                                when this became priority or a criterion to be hired then
                                people that lack the required skill are always ignored
                                because every establishment want people that have a
                                lot of impact to make to an organization in other to yield
                                positive result.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                People without skill are mostly ignored, overlook, and
                                assumed to be worthy of nothing because no relevant
                                skill manifest in them. They always lack confident, full of
                                doubt and anxiety, have no hope and feel disappointed
                                mostly when they went for interview and not hired due
                                to their inability of acquiring the skill needed, that dilemma will tend to dwell in them for life time unless
                                when they decided to venture into a skill that will in turn
                                stand them out amidst the crowd.
                                Lack of skill acquisition give way for poverty to step into
                                the society, lack of skill increases the rate of
                                unemployment, diminish standard of living and as can
                                well increase the crime rate of any society because
                                joblessness can cause people to commit crime in other
                                to survive.

                                Employees are always interested in fulfilling their duties well
                                to improve the company’s outcome, feel a sense of pride for a
                                job well done and get promoted to a higher rank in that
                                organization but when there is no skill, employees will not
                                know the best way to do their jobs and none of these goals
                                will be possible to achieve. This lower the driving force among
                                the workers, which contribute to the employee turnover. A
                                company with a reputation for high employee turnover is also
                                attractive to potential job candidates.
                                There will be low production rate which is as a result of the
                                employee lacking enough skill and experience to perform their
                                jobs confidently. To save time, employers often delegate the
                                task of training to employees who have been on the job
                                longer. But many times, these employees aren't given extra
                                time to do so; they still need to complete their own work. So,
                                they rush through the training, or leave it up to the new
                                employee to ask questions.
